What is PAExec.exe?
PAExec is a remote administration tool designed as an alternative to psexec. The tool is a small remote shell that includes functionality for copying files, remote execution, and fully interactive shell sessions with remote Windows machines without the need to install client software.
PsExec facilitates file and registry access on remote systems, allowing administrators to perform tasks such as copying files, executing scripts, or modifying registry settings.
PsExec activity always involves remote service creation. The Windows Security EventCode for this activity is 7045 and the default name is PSEXESVC.
PsExec begins by extracting from its executable image an embedded Windows service called Psexesvc. The service is copied to the Admin$ share of the remote system. Windows Service Control Manager API is then used to have a remote interface with the target computer
PsExec allows for remote command execution (and receipt of resulting output) over a named pipe with the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which runs on TCP port 445.
